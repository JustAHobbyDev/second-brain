# Session Preamble — Second Brain Workflow

This session operates under my second-brain architecture.

## Mental Model

* Work is a state transition.
* Each session moves a project from State_n → State_n+1.
* A structured artifact will capture the transition.
* Resumption must be deterministic.

---

## Before We Begin

Project:

* project/<ID>

Governing principles (choose 1–2):

* principle/architecture_portable_tools_not
* principle/principles_over_rules
* principle/agent_builds_agent_maintains
* principle/system_as_infrastructure

Optional structural reference:

* pattern/dan_codex_meta_workflow_v1
* pattern/session_artifact_resumption_loop

---

## During This Session

Make explicit:

* Key decisions
* Architectural changes
* Tradeoffs
* Failure modes
* Open questions

Assume this will be resumed later.

---

## Before Closing

We will emit a structured session artifact that includes:

* High-level summary
* Key decisions
* Changes made
* Open questions
* Links to project, principles, patterns, tools
* Notes for future agents

Artifact must allow resumption without memory.

---

## Goal

Convert ephemeral cognition into structured infrastructure.

State_n → Artifact → State_n+1
