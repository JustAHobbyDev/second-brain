  "summary": "Palantir defines ontology as a semantic layer that maps raw data into real-world objects, relationships, and logic. It decouples data pipelines from applications and embeds meaning, permissions, and operations directly into a shared object model.",
  "content": {
    "core_thesis": "Data has no inherent meaning. Meaning emerges when raw data is mapped into a structured ontology that defines objects, relationships, and behaviors aligned with real-world concepts.",
