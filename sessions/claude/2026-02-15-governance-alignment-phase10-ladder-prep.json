  "summary": "Session aligned repo workflow documentation (AGENTS.md) with canonical second-brain governance invariants (inv/observability_entropy, inv/vision_alignment, inv/agent_resumption_min_8, inv/derived_view_integrity). Codified KPI behavior as strict track-only (no automatic mutation of artifacts) and confirmed hard gates remain contracts-first. Prepared Phase 10 L1 Tier 1 additive promotion v5 script with position_plus_l1_tier1_v1 policy (4 L1 path features on price_position_only anchor), 11 contract tests, and Justfile task - all blocked on data gate (94 usable windows of 200 needed). Three checkpoints produced (v1.85-v1.87). Session crashed before normal closeout.",
  "key_decisions": [
    "KPI outputs are strict track-only: they can alert and propose but never block commits/merges or auto-mutate artifacts",
    "Hard gates remain contracts-first: contract tests + strict robustness gates + precommit checks are the only blocking mechanisms",

    "Phase 10 Tier 1 candidate policy defined as position_plus_l1_tier1_v1 (mid_change_rate, rv_front_half, rv_back_half, spread_mean on price_position_only anchor)",

  "open_questions": [
    "1. When will the data gate pass (>= 200 usable aligned windows)? Last count was 94 - estimated ~31 hours remaining at current capture rate",
    "2. What follow-on policy expansion plan should be used after minimal_price_v1 pass to recover full_v1-level edge without reintroducing stability-budget failures? (OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, unresolved)",
    "3. What exact Track2 L2 reconstruction contract should be enforced (snapshot cadence, delta replay invariants, checkpoint cadence, recovery policy)? (OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, unresolved)",
    "4. At what data volume should we switch from JSONL files to a columnar or indexed store? (OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, unresolved)"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Monitor data gate with `just phase10-count-windows` - run when capture daemon has accumulated enough hours",
    "When gate passes (>= 200 windows): execute full Phase 10 pipeline (phase10-build-features -> phase10-join-features -> phase9-anchor-additive-promotion-v5)",
    "If Tier 1 passes strict gate: implement Tier 2 L1 features; if fails: wait for more data or re-evaluate feature selection",
    "Route any KPI-suggested changes through OPEN_QUESTIONS.md per new governance policy"

Key state: Phase 10 code is fully ready (scripts/phase9_anchor_additive_promotion_v5.py, scripts/join_phase10_features.py) but blocked on data gate (94/200 usable windows). L1 capture daemon should still be running. Next action is checking `just phase10-count-windows` and running the pipeline when gate passes."
