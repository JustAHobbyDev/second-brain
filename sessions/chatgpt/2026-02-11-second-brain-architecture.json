  "title": "Establishing second-brain architecture and session closing ritual",
  "summary": {
    "high_level": "Designed and implemented a local-first, scene-based, graph-ready second brain architecture. Established repository structure, node ID conventions, session artifact schema, and formal session closing checklist. Clarified scene-based vs type-based file organization and finalized README.",
    "key_decisions": [
      "Adopt scene-based file organization rather than one-node-per-file.",
      "Use stable node IDs as architectural anchors; folders are non-canonical.",
      "Every meaningful session must emit a structured artifact on close.",
      "Keep infrastructure local and tool-agnostic (no DB yet).",
      "Implement session closing checklist to enforce discipline."
    ],
    "changes_made": [
      "Created repository structure with scenes/, sessions/, templates/, graph/.",
      "Added four_principles_second_brain scene.",
      "Added dan_codex_meta_workflow_v1 scene.",
      "Created codex_session_template.json.",
      "Created session_closing_checklist.md.",
      "Wrote README defining architecture and workflow."
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "When should session artifacts be auto-generated instead of manual copy/save?",
      "Should graph/graph.json become canonical or remain derived?",
      "When to introduce validation tooling or CLI support?",
      "How to query across sessions without full DB infrastructure?"
