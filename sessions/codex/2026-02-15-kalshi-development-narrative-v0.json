  "summary": "Evidence-only narrative from second-brain artifacts: (1) Phase 8 was closed out on 2026-02-12 with a handoff toward Phase 9 planning. (2) A 2026-02-13 codex audit focused on quote/orderbook scope and tightened robustness/audit framing. (3) Claude closeouts on 2026-02-13 and 2026-02-15 document Phase 10 Tier-1 additive-ladder readiness and governance alignment, but both remain blocked by the same data-sufficiency gate. (4) The pressure-test report on 2026-02-15 confirms gate status as blocked_by_data_gate with 94 usable windows versus 200 required (deficit 106). This indicates the current stop condition is functioning as intended, not a regression in process control.",

    "1. The 2026-02-15 Claude closeout references artifact/claude_2026_02_13_phase10-tasks-and-phase9-ladder-exhaust, but the available 2026-02-13 Claude file is 2026-02-13-phase10-ladder-prep-l1-tier1. Is this a naming drift or missing artifact?",
    "2. When will the Phase 10 data gate reach >=200 usable windows so blocked steps can execute?",
    "3. Should this narrative be mirrored into a dedicated Kalshi history scene node for one-hop retrieval?"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Run `just phase10-count-windows` in the Kalshi repo to re-check the gate.",
    "If gate passes, execute the documented Phase 10 pipeline sequence from the Claude closeout artifact.",
    "Repair artifact-id mismatch if a canonical 2026-02-13 Claude artifact slug is required."
