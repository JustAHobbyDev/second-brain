  "summary": {
    "high_level": "Session focused on inventorying available market data types in the current pipeline, assessing feasibility of adding missing quote datasets, and tightening the project one-line description.",
    "key_decisions": [
      "Current pipeline availability: trades are ingested and persisted; bid/ask/orderbook snapshots and dedicated mid series are not currently ingested/persisted.",
      "Feasibility assessment: acquiring missing datasets is high for forward capture (top-of-book and derived mid), medium-high for live depth capture, and low for deep historical L2 reconstruction.",
      "Project scope statement updated conceptually: repository has expanded beyond ingest/normalize/validate into modeling and robustness evaluation.",
      "Adopted concise description: \"Reproducible, auditable research pipeline for Kalshi BTC 15m market data and model robustness.\""
    ],
    "changes_made": [
      "No repo-tracked files were modified in this session.",
      "Performed non-mutating codebase/data audit via search and file inspection only."
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "What sampling cadence and retention policy should be used for future orderbook/top-of-book capture under account rate limits?"

    "If implementing quote ingestion next, propose two-track plan: historical L1 via candlesticks plus forward live recorder via websocket ticker/orderbook_delta."
