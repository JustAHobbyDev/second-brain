# Dan Cognitive Operating Model Template

Version: v0
Status: Experimental
Inputs:
- `sessions/` structured session artifacts
- `scenes/` project and phase-history artifacts
- `operations/` governance and operation specs
- `meta/` cross-epic constraints

Disclaimer: No psych claims; operational signals only.

## Signals to Extract
- Spec rewrites: count, scope, and frequency by day.
- Threshold changes: metric cutoffs and acceptance criteria adjustments.
- Governance interventions: explicit policy/checklist/schema decisions.
- Incumbent switching: replacement of primary method/tool/approach.
- Cleanup sessions: refactor or normalization passes that reduce ambiguity.

## Hypothesis Axes
- Systems-first vs incremental delivery orientation.
- Robustness-first vs novelty-first optimization.
- Governance-before-scale adherence.
- Exploration -> formalization conversion rate.

## Inflection Patterns
- Pre-breakthrough indicators: compressed rewrite cycles and rising decision clarity.
- Pre-instability indicators: frequent threshold changes without stable contracts.
- Cleanup triggers: repeated drift signals or unresolved governance conflicts.

## Data Needed
- Timestamped artifact deltas with stable path references.
- Decision logs tied to specific files/commits/sessions.
- Drift test outcomes across repeat runs.
- Explicit before/after threshold snapshots.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Signals are extracted from linked artifacts only.
- [ ] Hypotheses are framed as testable operational statements.
- [ ] Inflection patterns are evidence-backed and date-bounded.
- [ ] Data gaps are listed explicitly.
- [ ] Output contains no psychological interpretation.
